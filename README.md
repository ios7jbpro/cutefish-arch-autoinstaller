# cutefish-arch-autoinstaller
An autoinstaller for Arch based systems, as the ported one is a bit outdated compared to the one in Cutefish's GitHub. Just a simple sh file, run it and you're good to go. Thanks to @Stellastructure BTW!
# What does it do?
Installs the ported one first(pacman -S cutefish), then downloads and compiles the newer versions of the Cutefish apps, then replaces them with the one in pre-installed apps on port.
# Known issues for now
-No statusbar/topbar blur
-Some icons are glitched
